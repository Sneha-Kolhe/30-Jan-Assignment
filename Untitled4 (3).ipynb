    "In Python, a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's particularly useful when you want to perform an action repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Here's a detailed description of when and how to use a while loop in Python, along with an example:\n",

    "When to Use a While Loop:\n",
    "When you want to iterate based on a condition: If you need to repeat a block of code until a particular condition becomes false, a while loop is suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the number of iterations is not predetermined: Unlike for loops where you iterate over a predefined sequence, while loops are used when you don't know beforehand how many times you need to repeat the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the condition to terminate the loop might change within the loop: while loops are handy when the condition for termination depends on some dynamic changes happening inside the loop.\n",
